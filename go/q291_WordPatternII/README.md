# Description
Given a pattern and a string str, find if strfollows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty substring in str.

Example 1:
"abab"
"redblueredblue"

Example 2:
"aaaa"
"asdasdasdasd"

Example 3:
"aabb"
"xyzabcxzyabc"

Notes:
You may assume both pattern and str contains only lowercase letters.
